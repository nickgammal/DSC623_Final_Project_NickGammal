# DSC623_Final_Project_NickGammal
Final Project for Database Management course at the University of Miami


Hello,

Welcome to my final project for DSC 623. Parts one and two of the project entailed defining the conceptual and logical data models for a client called Pawsome Pets. Part 3 of the project involved translating the logical model into code using Python and SQLite. The folders for parts one and two contain my responses to the project instruction prompts as well as the files associated with my ER diagrams. The part three folder contains all my code files and associated documentation. Note that when I did my work, I used the project_p3 jupyter notebook, then my code was split up into .py files as required by my professor.
